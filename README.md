The Cultural Tourism Recommendation System is a Java-based program designed to provide personalized recommendations for tourists visiting Ethiopia. The system takes into account the tourists' preferences, interests, and the unique cultural and historical attractions of different regions in Ethiopia. It offers recommendations for destinations based on the type of experience desired (e.g., Historical, Nature, Cultural, Adventure) and the preferred region specified by the user.
